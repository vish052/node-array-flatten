# node-array-flatten

A modern, efficient, and lightweight utility for flattening nested arrays in Node.js and JavaScript environments. This package leverages the native `Array.prototype.flat()` method for optimal performance and simplicity, providing a robust solution for transforming multi-dimensional arrays into single-dimensional ones.

## Features

* **Optimal Performance:** Utilizes the highly optimized native `Array.prototype.flat()` for fast array flattening.
* **Depth Control:** Supports flattening to a specified depth or completely flattening all nested arrays.
* **Simple API:** Easy to use with a clear and intuitive function signature.
* **Robust Input Validation:** Ensures the input is always an array, throwing an error for invalid types.
